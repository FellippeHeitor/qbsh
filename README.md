QBSH - Quick BASIC Shell
========================

This is an attempt at making a command line shell with [QB64](https://www.qb64.org).  Unhandled commands are offloaded to the native shell (bash, etc.).  This is a very early project, so your mileage may vary and use this at your own risk!

# Compiling

To compile this project, you'll need to load it into qb64 and either run or make executable from there.
